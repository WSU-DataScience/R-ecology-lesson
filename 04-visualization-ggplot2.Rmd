We start by loading the required packages. **`ggplot2`** is included in the **`tidyverse`** package,  and is the current standard for data visualization in R.  Authored by Hadley Wickham, `gg` stands for "Grammar of Graphics."  In learning `ggplot2`, you may find the following [cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) to be a helpful reference.

```{r load-package, message=FALSE, purl=FALSE, , warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```



## Overview

###Basic grammar

Hadley's Grammar of Graphics is outlined in detail in [this article](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf).  Here, he illustrates his principles using a small data set similar to the following:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(A = c(2,1,4,9),
                 B  = c(4,1,15,80),
                 C = c(1,2,3,4),
                 D = c('far','far','near','near'))
head(df)
```

To visualize any data set using the Grammar of Graphics, it helps to understand the 3 components of which any graph is comprised:

1. Geoms
2. Scales
3. Data columns


 **Geoms** are the visual entities that we see on a graph. In the image below, we see three examples of geoms: a circular ***point***, a ***bar***, and a ***line***:
 
 ![](img/geoms.png)



**Scales** control how the **data columns** map to the aesthetic attributes of the geoms.  For example, is the point geom *yellow* or *blue*?  Is it *large* or *small*?  Is it *high* or *low*?  *Left* or *right*? These aesthetic attributes are respectively controlled by the **color**, **size**,  **y**, and **x** scales: 

![](img/scales.png)



Additional scales in `ggplot2` are:


* **shape**
* **linetype** (for the line geom)
* **fill** (for the bar and point geoms)

 

Any plot created with `ggplot2` requires these ingredients.  To create a plot, one must specify the desired geom; which data variables are to be aesthetically mapped to the geom; and the scales to use to control the mapping.  The skeleton of any `ggplot2` command is as follows; parts in italics are to be replaced with specific data variable names, geoms, and scales:


**ggplot(data = *nameofdata*) + geom_*nameofgeom*(aes(*scale1* = *variable1*, *scale2* = *variable2*))**



At a minimum, most geoms require the `x` scale.  



Let's begin by mapping `A` and `B` to the `point` geom on a Cartesian plane.  Note in `?geom_point` that two scales are required for aesthetic mappings to point geoms, **x** and **y**:

```{r,warning=FALSE,fig.height = 3, fig.width=4,fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = df) + geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B))
```

We can employ other scales outside of aesthetic data mappings.  For example, if we want to change the aesthetic mapping of the above scatterplot by changing the **shape**, **color**, and **size** scale, we can do so with the following:
```{r,warning=FALSE,fig.height = 3, fig.width=4,fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = df) + geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B), shape = 17,color='red',size=4)
```

Notice in the above code that the scales that are not mapped to data are *outside* the `aes()` command.  

As an aside, looking at the `?shape` help file, we can find code to see all possible shapes:

```{r,warning=FALSE,fig.height = 3, fig.width=4,fig.align='center'}
df2 <- data.frame(x = 1:5 , y = 1:25, z = 1:25)
s <- ggplot(df2, aes(x = x, y = y))
s + geom_point(aes(shape = z), size = 4) + scale_shape_identity()
```


Now suppose we want to aesthetically map other variables with the **shape**, **color**, and **size** scales.  We must now put these specifications inside the `aes()` command and specify the variables we wish to map.  Consider the following code, and note the different looks, error messages and warnings that appear when attempting to apply aesthetic mappings using various scales depending on the data type. In `ggplot`-speak, "continuous" refers to quantitative data in general; while "discrete" refers to categorical data: 



```{r,warning=FALSE,fig.height = 4, fig.width=4.5,eval=FALSE}
#Mapping continuous C with size:
ggplot(data = df) + geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B, size = C))
#Mapping continuous C with size and color:
ggplot(data = df) + geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B, size = C, color = C))
#Mapping continuous C with shape:
ggplot(data = df) + geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B, shape = C))
```

```{r,warning=FALSE,fig.height = 4, fig.width=4.5,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df) + geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B, size = C))
ggplot(data = df) + geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B, size = C, color = C))
```

> ###Challenge
> Re-create the following plots:

```{r,recreate1, warning=FALSE,fig.height = 3, fig.width=4.5,echo=FALSE}
#Mapping discrete D with shape:
ggplot(data = df) + geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B, shape = D), size = 4)
```
```{r,recreate2, warning=FALSE,fig.height = 3, fig.width=4.5,echo=FALSE}
#Mapping discrete D with shape:
ggplot(data = df) + geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B, color = D), size = 4)
```
```{r,recreate3, warning=FALSE,fig.height = 3, fig.width=4.5,echo=FALSE}
#Mapping discrete D with shape and color:
ggplot(data = df) + geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B, shape = D,color=D), size = 4)
```
```{r,recreate4, warning=FALSE,fig.height = 3, fig.width=4.5,echo=FALSE}
#Mapping discrete D with shape and color:
ggplot(data = df) + geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B, shape = D,color=D,size=C))
```


Note some interesting concepts illustrated here:

* *Continuous* (numeric, quantitative) variables should be mapped using **size** or **color** scales; these are the scales that can encode quantity.
* *Discrete* (categorical) variables should be mapped with **shape** or **color** scales; these are the scales that are best used for indicating "categories."  

###Layers

A very important aspect of the `ggplot2` package is the idea of *layers*.  Aesthetic mappings to different geoms can take place simply by specifying additional mappings with a `+` sign.  For example, suppose we want to create the above scatterplots with points *and* lines.  This requires two aesthetic mappings: one from the data to the points geom, and one from the data to the lines geom.  We can see this in what follows.  Note that because both `geom_point()` and `geom_line()` rely on the same aesthetic mapping, we could simplify the code by specifiying the appropriate mapping in the initial `ggplot()` command. The following two lines of code are equivalent:



```{r,warning=FALSE,fig.height = 3, fig.width=4.5,eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df) + geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B), size = 4) + geom_line(aes(x = A,y=B))
ggplot(aes(x = A, y = B), data = df) + geom_point(size = 4) + geom_line()
```

```{r,warning=FALSE,fig.height = 3, fig.width=4.5,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = df) + geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B), size = 4) + geom_line(aes(x = A,y=B))
```

> ###Challenge

> variable `C` to `geom_line()` using the **size** scale?

```{r,recreate5, warning=FALSE,fig.height = 3, fig.width=4.5,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df) + geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B,shape=D,color=D), size = 5) + geom_line(aes(x = A,y=B),size=2)
```
```{r,recreate6, warning=FALSE,fig.height = 3, fig.width=4.5,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df) +  geom_line(aes(x = A,y=B),size=2) + geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B,shape=D,color=D), size = 5)
```
```{r,recreate7,warning=FALSE,fig.height = 3, fig.width=4.5,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df)  + geom_line(aes(x = A,y=B,color=D),size=2)+ geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B,shape=D), size = 4)
```
```{r,recreate8,warning=FALSE,fig.height = 3, fig.width=4.5,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df)  + geom_line(aes(x = A,y=B,linetype=D,color=D),size=2)+ geom_point(aes(x = A,y=B,shape=D), size = 4)
```


##Analysis of ecology data

Now let's start visualizing some real data.  If not still in the workspace, load the data we saved in the previous lesson.
```{r load-data, eval=FALSE,  purl=FALSE}
surveys <- read.csv('data/portal_data_joined.csv')
```


When plotting scatterplots, ggplot likes data in the 'long' format: i.e., a column for every dimension,
and a row for every observation. However, when plotting barplots where the height of the bars are counts or percents,
pre-aggregated data (e.g., the output from a series of `dplyr` commands) may work better.  Well-structured data will save you lots of time
when making figures with ggplot.

To create a scatterplot of hind foot length versus weight, we need to: 

- bind the plot to a specific data frame using the `data` argument

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys )
```

- define aesthetics (`aes`), by selecting the variables to be plotted and the scales to define the geoms

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys , aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))
```

- add `geoms` -- graphical representation of the data in the plot (points,
     lines, bars). To add a geom to the plot use `+` operator

```{r first-ggplot, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point()
```

Recall that the `+` in the **`ggplot2`** package allows you
to modify existing `ggplot` objects. This means you can easily set up plot
"templates" and conveniently explore different types of plots, so the above
plot can also be generated with code like this:

```{r, first-ggplot-with-plus, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# Assign plot to a variable
surveys_plot <- ggplot(data = surveys , aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))

# Draw the plot
surveys_plot + geom_point()
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
## Create a ggplot and draw it.
surveys_plot <- ggplot(data = surveys , aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))
surveys_plot + geom_point()
```

Remember:

- Anything you put in the `ggplot()` function can be seen by any geom layers
  that you add (i.e., these are universal plot settings). This includes the x and
  y axis you set up in `aes()`.
- You can also specify aesthetics for a given geom independently of the
  aesthetics defined globally in the `ggplot()` function.
- The `+` sign used to add layers must be placed at the end of each line containing
a layer. If, instead, the `+` sign is added in the line before the other layer,
**`ggplot2`** will not add the new layer and will return an error message.

```{r, ggplot-with-plus-position, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# this is the correct syntax for adding layers
surveys_plot +
  geom_point()

# this will not add the new layer and will return an error message
surveys_plot
  + geom_point()
```

## Building your plots iteratively

Building plots with ggplot is typically an iterative process. We start by
defining the dataset we'll use, lay the axes, and choose a geom:

```{r create-ggplot-object, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys , aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point()
```

Then, we start modifying this plot to extract more information from it. For
instance, we can add transparency (`alpha`) to avoid overplotting:

```{r adding-transparency, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys , aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```

We can also add colors for all the points:

```{r adding-colors, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys , aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color = "blue")
```

Or to color each species in the plot differently:

```{r color-by-species, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys , aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.1, aes(color=species_id))
```

> ### Challenge
>
> Use what you just learned to create a scatter plot of `weight` over `species_id` with the plot types showing in different colors.
> Is this a good way to show this type of data?

```{r scatter-challenge, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Challenge with scatter plot:
##
##  Use what you just learned to create a scatter plot of `weight`
## over `species_id` with the plot types showing in different colors.
## Is this a good way to show this type of data?
ggplot(data = surveys , aes(x = species_id, y = weight,color=species_id)) + geom_point()
```


## Boxplot

We can use boxplots to visualize the distribution of weight within each species:

```{r boxplot, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys , aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

By adding points to boxplot, we can have a better idea of the number of
measurements and of their distribution:

```{r boxplot-with-points, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys , aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = "tomato")
```

Notice how the boxplot layer is behind the jitter layer? What do you need to
change in the code to put the boxplot in front of the points such that it's not
hidden?

```{r boxplot-challenge, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
## Challenge with boxplots:
##  Start with the boxplot we created:
ggplot(data = surveys , aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0) + scale_y_log10()
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = "tomato")

##  1. Replace the box plot with a violin plot; see `geom_violin()`.

##  2. Represent weight on the log10 scale; see `scale_y_log10()`.

##  3. Create boxplot for `hindfoot_length` overlaid on a jitter layer.

##  4. Add color to the datapoints on your boxplot according to the
##  plot from which the sample was taken (`plot_id`).
##  Hint: Check the class for `plot_id`. Consider changing the class
##  of `plot_id` from integer to factor. Why does this change how R
##  makes the graph?

```

## Bar graphs

Bar graphs are frequently used for visualizing the number of observations in each category
of a categorical variable, or summary statistics (like a mean or median) of a quantitative variable across
levels of a categorical variable.  

By default, `ggplot` counts the number of observations in each level and plots those counts on the y-axis.  For example, consider plotting the number of each sex in the data set:

```{r sex-bargraph}
ggplot(data = surveys , aes(x = sex)) +
    geom_bar()
```

However, what if we wanted to visualize the average hind foot length for each sex instead?  
We first need to use `dplyr` to group the data by sex and compute the mean length.  We can
also filter out the unlabeled sexes:

```{r agg-sex}
length_sex <- surveys  %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(mean_length = mean(hindfoot_length, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  filter(sex != '')

length_sex
```

We now want to map the `mean_length` variable to the **y** scale.  We must specify
`stat='identity'` inside the `geom_bar()` command, to specify that we want to use the
actual values in the `mean_length` column on the y-axis instead of the default count:

```{r sex-length-bargraph}
ggplot(data = length_sex, aes(x = sex,y = mean_length)) +
    geom_bar(stat='identity')
```

> ### Challenges

> * Create a bar graph that shows the number of each species in each data set.  What are the issues with this plot?
> * Use `group_by()`, `summarize()`, `n()` and `mean()` to create a data set with the species IDs in one column, 
> the number of observations in the second column, and the mean hind foot length in the third column.  
> * Filter this data set to contain only the species with 5 or more entries. Re-create the bar graph showing the count of each species.
> * Create a second bar graph showing the mean foot length of each species.  Which has the largest?  The smallest?



## Plotting time series data

Let's calculate number of counts per year for each species. First we need
to group the data and count records within each group:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
yearly_counts <- surveys  %>%
                 group_by(year, species_id) %>%
                 tally
```

Timelapse data can be visualized as a line plot with years on the x axis and counts
on the y axis:

```{r first-time-series, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = yearly_counts, aes(x = year, y = n)) +
     geom_line()
```

Unfortunately, this does not work because we plotted data for all the species
together. We need to tell ggplot to draw a line for each species by modifying
the aesthetic function to include `group = species_id`:

```{r time-series-by-species, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = yearly_counts, aes(x = year, y = n, group = species_id)) +
    geom_line()
```

We will be able to distinguish species in the plot if we add colors (using `color` also automatically groups the data):

```{r time-series-with-colors, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = yearly_counts, aes(x = year, y = n, color = species_id)) +
    geom_line()
```

## Faceting

ggplot has a special technique called *faceting* that allows the user to split one plot
into multiple plots based on a factor included in the dataset. We will use it to
make a time series plot for each species:

```{r first-facet, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = yearly_counts, aes(x = year, y = n)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(~ species_id)
```

Now we would like to split the line in each plot by the sex of each individual
measured. To do that we need to make counts in the data frame grouped by `year`,
`species_id`, and `sex`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
 yearly_sex_counts <- surveys  %>%
                      group_by(year, species_id, sex) %>%
                      tally
```

We can now make the faceted plot by splitting further by sex using `color` (within a single plot):

```{r facet-by-species-and-sex, purl=FALSE}
 ggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
     geom_line() +
     facet_wrap(~ species_id)
```

Usually plots with white background look more readable when printed.  We can set
the background to white using the function `theme_bw()`. Additionally, you can remove
the grid:

```{r facet-by-species-and-sex-white-bg, purl=FALSE}
 ggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
     geom_line() +
     facet_wrap(~ species_id) +
     theme_bw() +
     theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```

## **`ggplot2`** themes

In addition to `theme_bw()`, which changes the plot background to white, **`ggplot2`**
comes with several other themes which can be useful to quickly change the look
of your visualization. The complete list of themes is available
at <http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/ggtheme.html>. `theme_minimal()` and
`theme_light()` are popular, and `theme_void()` can be useful as a starting
point to create a new hand-crafted theme.

The
[ggthemes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggthemes/vignettes/ggthemes.html) package
provides a wide variety of options (including an Excel 2003 theme).
The [**`ggplot2`** extensions website](https://www.ggplot2-exts.org) provides a list
of packages that extend the capabilities of **`ggplot2`**, including additional
themes.

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
### Plotting time series challenge:
##
##  Use what you just learned to create a plot that depicts how the
##  average weight of each species changes through the years.

```

The `facet_wrap` geometry extracts plots into an arbitrary number of dimensions
to allow them to cleanly fit on one page. On the other hand, the `facet_grid`
geometry allows you to explicitly specify how you want your plots to be
arranged via formula notation (`rows ~ columns`; a `.` can be used as
a placeholder that indicates only one row or column).

Let's modify the previous plot to compare how the weights of males and females
has changed through time:

```{r average-weight-time-facet-sex-rows, purl=FALSE}
# One column, facet by rows
yearly_sex_weight <- surveys  %>%
    group_by(year, sex, species_id) %>%
    summarize(avg_weight = mean(weight))
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_weight, aes(x=year, y=avg_weight, color = species_id)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_grid(sex ~ .)
```

```{r average-weight-time-facet-sex-columns, purl=FALSE}
# One row, facet by column
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_weight, aes(x=year, y=avg_weight, color = species_id)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_grid(. ~ sex)
```

## Customization

Take a look at the [**`ggplot2`** cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf), and
think of ways you could improve the plot.

Now, let's change names of axes to something more informative than 'year'
and 'n' and add a title to the figure:

```{r number-species-year-with-right-labels, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(~ species_id) +
    labs(title = 'Observed species in time',
         x = 'Year of observation',
         y = 'Number of species') +
    theme_bw()
```

The axes have more informative names, but their readability can be improved by
increasing the font size:

```{r number-species-year-with-right-labels-xfont-size, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(~ species_id) +
    labs(title = 'Observed species in time',
        x = 'Year of observation',
        y = 'Number of species') +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(text=element_text(size=16))
```

Note that it is also possible to change the fonts of your plots. If you are on
Windows, you may have to install
the [**extrafont** package](https://github.com/wch/extrafont), and follow the
instructions included in the README for this package.

After our manipulations, you may notice that the values on the x-axis are still not
properly readable. Let's change the orientation of the labels and adjust them
vertically and horizontally so they don't overlap. You can use a 90 degree
angle, or experiment to find the appropriate angle for diagonally oriented
labels:

```{r number-species-year-with-theme, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(~ species_id) +
    labs(title = 'Observed species in time',
        x = 'Year of observation',
        y = 'Number of species') +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20", size=12, angle=90, hjust=.5, vjust=.5),
                        axis.text.y = element_text(colour="grey20", size=12),
          text=element_text(size=16))
```

If you like the changes you created better than the default theme, you can save them as
an object to be able to easily apply them to other plots you may create:


```{r number-species-year-with-right-labels-xfont-orientation, purl=FALSE}
grey_theme <- theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20", size=12, angle=90, hjust=.5, vjust=.5),
                          axis.text.y = element_text(colour="grey20", size=12),
                          text=element_text(size=16))
ggplot(surveys , aes(x = species_id, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    grey_theme
```

> ### Challange

> With all of this information in hand, please take another five minutes to either
> improve one of the plots generated in this exercise or create a beautiful graph
> of your own. Use the RStudio [**`ggplot2`** cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf) for
> inspiration.

> Here are some ideas:

> * See if you can change the thickness of the lines.
> * Can you find a way to change the name of the legend? What about its labels?
> * Try using a different color palette (see http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/).


After creating your plot, you can save it to a file in your favorite format.
You can easily change the dimension (and resolution) of your plot by
adjusting the appropriate arguments (`width`, `height` and `dpi`):

```{r ggsave-example, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
my_plot <- ggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(~ species_id) +
    labs(title = 'Observed species in time',
        x = 'Year of observation',
        y = 'Number of species') +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20", size=12, angle=90, hjust=.5, vjust=.5),
                        axis.text.y = element_text(colour="grey20", size=12),
          text=element_text(size=16))
ggsave("name_of_file.png", my_plot, width=15, height=10)
```

Note: The parameters `width` and `height` also determine the font size in the saved plot.


```{r final-challenge, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
